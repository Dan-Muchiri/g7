            In 2008 G7 created the New Ventures division to encourage Youth Entrepreneurship and to bring sustainable employment to rural youth who haven't had the opportunity of a University education.  To that end, we brought BRyan Polson on board to drive this division, leveraging his experience with training youth on entrepreneurship and micro-finance through the Junior Achievement program that he spearheaded in 15 schools throughout Western Kenya during 2007. Our first business, "Serenity Salon" was opened in September 2009.

            In 2008, Geoff Ridden, the trumpet-playing founder of G7, discovered Kenyan music legend John Nzenze performing at a club in Khayega. Their mutual respect and friendship grew, and Nzenze revealed his strugglesâ€”despite his long career, he had little to show for it due to piracy and unethical management, a plight shared by many Kenyan musicians. In response, Geoff founded "Shieywe Trust" in June 2009, a recording label aimed at offering fair opportunities and contracts to Kenyan artists. Operating from a studio in Kakamega, Shieywe Trust's first CD is a collaboration between Nzenze and Geoff titled "A New Twiste."

                    AFRETECH began in 1992 when Canadian teachers Bonnie and Don Sutherland visited a school in Zimbabwe and were struck by the lack of resources. Inspired by the students' eagerness to learn, they sent a shipment of supplies to the school. In 1994, Bonnie met Geoff Ridden, CEO of G7 Systems, during her Executive MBA program at Simon Fraser University. Their friendship led to a joint effort to install a computer lab in rural Zimbabwe in 1999. Realizing the potential impact, they formalized AFRETECH as an official charity, ensuring that all donations went directly to projects. AFRETECH, now a registered Canadian charity and 501(c)3 in the U.S., has since built computer facilities and clinics in Kenya, including a new clinic near Imbale school in Kakamega, aiming to improve education and healthcare in rural communities.
